# wordpress-dependencies

This is a repository generated using [**Satis**](https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/handling-private-packages-with-satis.md) for WordPress projects.  It it a proof-of-concept for a client 
whose goal was to locate all their WordPress website dependencies that are "composed" by [**Composer**](https://getcomposer.org) to GitHub 
which allows them to also push to an internal Git remote.  

Chances are this repo won't be here long.
